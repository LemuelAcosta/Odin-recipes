    <h2>How to make it</h2>
    <P>
        I came up with this mozzarella grilled 
        cheese recipe for my niece. I combined
         grilled cheese sandwiches with garlic
        bread. It's tasty, quick, and the perfect
         appetizer for friends, family, and 
         unexpected guests. Use a firm white bread 
         for best results.
    </P>
    <p>You'll find a detailed ingredient list 
        and step-by-step instructions in the 
        recipe below, but let's go over the basics:

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
